		<h4>About Meta tags</h4>
		<p>Meta tags are useful for storing information that search engines rely on to find and display a webpage within the results. Search engines that rely on meta tags include Google, Duck Duck Go, and Bing</p>
		<p>Meta Tag types can best be remembered by the acronym <b>D.A.C.K.</b></p>
		<p>
		<u><b>D</b>escription</u>- the blurb under the website title that gives you a preview of site content <br />
		<u><b>A</b>uthor</u>-the name of who authored the website<br />
		<u><b>C</b>harset</u>- I'm not sure what this is yet, but it usually is set to UTF-8<br />
		<u><b>K</b>eywords</u>- This is how the search engine determines which sites are relevant to the search term.</p>

		<h4>About Validation</h4>
		<p>There are three ways to validate a webpage or check the html document for errors:
			<ul>
			<li>By URL</li>
			<li>By File Upload</li>
			<li>By Direct Input</li>
			<ul>
			</p>
		<p>Since I am a novice user, and am not saving my documents as html at the moment, I will be using direct input.
		I had been using jsbin for this purpose, but I will also verify through the <a ref="https://validator.w3.org">W3C Markup Validation Service</a> so I can gain experience with using this tool.</p>

		<h4>CSS New Terms </h4>
		<p>There are some new terms in CSS that I have not previously learned. They will be defined in the list below in the order that I learned about them.</p>
		<ol>
		<li><b>em</b><br />
		This allows the text to be rendered more flexibly. If a user sets their computer defaults to magnify or shrink all the text on their screen, this setting will allow the browser to follow this rule. Otherwise, the text will always be the same size (by using px) no matter what. 1em equals the default size of the element. 2em will double the font-size, and so on.</li><br />
		<li><b>Justified Alignment</b><br />
		This makes the margins on both the left and the right side of the paragraphs even and flush by changing the spacing between words. It creates a nice, even look on webpages</li><br />
		<li><b>Font-Family Rule</b><br />
		It is recommended to use 3 fonts for each specification. The most unique and preferred to the most generic that every computer and browser supports, just in case. A good recommendation is to make the 3rd "fallback" option either serif (fancy) or sans-serif (easier to read)</li>
		</ol>

		<h3>Introduction</h3>

		<p>This is my html webpages demonstrating what I learned from the course <b><i>Master the Basics of HTML5 and CSS3: Beginner Web Development</i></b>. 
I am viewing the videos first and then trying to apply what I learned on this page from memory.</p>

		<p>One of the first new things I leaned about is the break. 
<br /> From videos 5 and 6, I learned about nesting tags to add more than one styling element 
to text and how to change colors for the background and text. You can see examples of my 
use of these skills in this page.</p>

		<h3>All About Audio and Video Tags</h3>

		<p>Audio and Video tags allow you to put in audio and video files without the use of extensions like Flash or Quicktime. For audio, WAV has the most compatibility across browsers.
<h6><b><i><a href="http://html5test.com">html5test.com</a> can keep you updated on what browsers support what formats</i></b></h6>
</p>
		<p>Since different browsers will display content differently, it is recommended to have all four major browsers installed on your designated programming computer:
			<ul>
				<li>Chrome</li>
				<li>Firefox</li>
				<li>Safari</li>
				<li>Microsoft Edge</li>
			</ul>
		<p>

		<p>To convert one file type to another for compatibility across multiple browsers, you can visit <a href="https://www.online-convert.com">online-convert.com</a>. Below is an image of what the audio tag may look like within the html code:<br />

		<p> Video tags are not as commonly utilized. Video hosting is expensive, and there is very little uniformity across browsers, so you would need to host 4 different files for every video to ensure compatibility. Therefore, Flash and Quicktime are still go-tos for video hosting on many sites.</p>

<!-- Assignment 1: 12/13 Lines Correct for Basic HTML 5 -->
<!-- Assignment 2: 0/3 inline and internal CSS styles displayed correctly (nesting and colors) -->
<!-- Assignment 5: 20/21 formats correct. Errors: Closing tag of <li> and needed to change a bullet point created with a <br /> and hyphen to heading 6 -->
